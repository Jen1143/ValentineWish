  "greetingText": "So apparently it’s Valentine’s Day and I’m writing you a digital letter because apparently we require addresses for physical things.
Anyway. \n
I like you.....wait I like you? OMG wait I might just love you. Like love-love you??? WHAT even!? \n
Things I might not always be able to say — \n
you calm me; \n
And somehow you feel like home after a vacation, \n
Like coming back and finally exhaling; \n
I like us, how we just fit together; \n
How I’m staying (and waiting patiently ke Maharaj kab aaenge) \n
How choosing you feels natural, as if you always belonged with me!!! \n
Also yes, full disclosure: I fully intend to brainwash you into loving me forever. And this is a threat!!! \n
Okay bas. \n
Before I overthink this and ruin the moment, \n
Happy Valentine’s Day mera kuchupuchu aloo paratha muaahhhh \n
Babe, are you the French Revolution?
Because I am losing my head over you. 😚💗",

Na tere bina lagda ji,
Tu ki jaane pyaar mera
Main karun intezar tera
Tu dil tui yon jaan meri",
