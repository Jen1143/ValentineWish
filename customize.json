  "greetingText": "Hi.
So apparently it’s Valentine’s Day and I’m writing you a digital letter because apparently we require addresses for physical things.
Anyway.
I like you.
…wait I like you?
OMG wait I might just love you.
Like love-love you???
WHAT even!? 
Things I might not always be able to say —
you calm me;
And somehow you feel like home after a vacation,
Like coming back and finally exhaling;
I like us, how we just fit together;
How I’m staying (and waiting patiently ke Maharaj kab aaenge)
How choosing you feels natural, as if you always belonged with me!!!
Also yes, full disclosure: I fully intend to brainwash you into loving me forever.
And this is a threat!!!
Okay bas.
Before I overthink this and ruin the moment,
Happy Valentine’s Day mera kuchupuchu aloo paratha muaahhhh
Babe, are you the French Revolution?
Because I am losing my head over you. 😚💗"

Na tere bina lagda ji

Tu ki jaane pyaar mera
Main karun intezar tera
Tu dil tui yon jaan meri",
